Get all possible combinations of nodes.
Nodes go in. 

M - columns
N - rows
 - will give all possible positions at which an intersection may occur

Data In: Giant matrix of zeros and ones.

1. Weed out the imposible/bad points and enforce the must have points.

 awesome possum.

We are just making arrangements at this point. This is initially done randomly and then optimized later.
